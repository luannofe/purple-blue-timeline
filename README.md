## How it was

That was the first full project I made on React, there is some messy lines on the code, but overall I think it's good for the first time. The app is functional and does what it's meant to. After the completion, I can say i'm more confident with Firebase, Javascript and even React, which was the hardest one. Next project will be cleaner, stay tuned :)
